## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in LAMS, _please report them_!

1. Send an email to [mail.lams.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mail.lams.dev@gmail.com)
2. Describe the vunerability to the best of your ability, noting the following:

   - The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

3. We will take a look at and fix the vulernability, if possible. In the meantime, **please do not discuss it publicly.** Once a fix or statement has been established, you are free to do so.
